Approach-> the approach for that question is fir we put our all elements in the queue. then we run a while loop until queue size is equal to 1 and inside that loop run a for loop until k and 
remove and add the queue and outside that loop remove element ant that element is kth element 
after that the one element is left is our answer

import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        Queue<Integer> q=new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) q.add(i);
        while(q.size()>1){
            for(int i=1;i<k;i++){
                q.add(q.remove());
            }
            q.remove();
        }
        return q.peek();
    }
}
