//Approach 
for this first I create an hashset and run a loop and traverse full array and add elements which are greater than 0 inside the set
then run another for loop and use .contains function to check wheather the perticular number in present or not in the array 
we use hashSet because we know that TC of searching any element in the set is O(1) .
