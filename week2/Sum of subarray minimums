the question says that we find  all possible suubarray minimums sum for this if we use brute force that is create all possible 
subarrays and calculate all minimums and sum it run in O(n)^2 because in this for calculating all posible subarrays we use nested loop
and then for large testcases it gives tle so for decrease complexity.


I use stack we find range of all elements in which our element is minimum we create two arrays to calculate range and calculate range 
using stack like next smaller element then we multiply our current element and range and add it in our ans

and this soln I implement our own stack to reduce time complexity we know that when we use inbuilt it import its all functions
and own stack I create an array of same size that our input array and assume it our owm stack and one variable idx which give him 
our peek element.
