https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-string-length-after-removing-substrings/submissions/1889536076

//Approach
for this question I use two approaches 1st is brute force and 2nd is optimal in brute force I check both cases like if out currect character is A then I check if it contains that
substring if it contains then we again call the same function after removing that substring and when we reach end of the index then I directly return the length of string

and in the optimal I use stack for check an element like if st.peek is A then direct pop A and go to next index using continue.
