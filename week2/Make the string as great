//Approach 
approach for this code is same as previous code I write two approaches for this code 1st is brute force using recursion when we 
hit the condition that is two adjacent character in which one char is small and one char is capital like a and A adjacent to each
then we pass new string at same function and if any string we can't get any character then we can direct return that string.
//and the 2nd approach 
Using stack we push our elements for every element we check our peek element if it hit the condition then we direct pop that element.
